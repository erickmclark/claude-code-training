# Advanced setup

> System requirements, platform-specific installation, version management, and uninstallation for Claude Code.

This page covers system requirements, platform-specific installation details, updates, and uninstallation. For a guided walkthrough of your first session, see the [quickstart](/en/quickstart). If you've never used a terminal before, see the [terminal guide](/en/terminal-guide).

## System requirements

Claude Code runs on the following platforms and configurations:

* **Operating system**:
  * macOS 13.0+
  * Windows 10 1809+ or Windows Server 2019+
  * Ubuntu 20.04+
  * Debian 10+
  * Alpine Linux 3.19+
* **Hardware**: 4 GB+ RAM
* **Network**: internet connection required. See [network configuration](/en/network-config#network-access-requirements).
* **Shell**: Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, or CMD. On Windows, [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) is required.
* **Location**: [Anthropic supported countries](https://www.anthropic.com/supported-countries)

### Additional dependencies

* **ripgrep**: usually included with Claude Code. If search fails, see [search troubleshooting](/en/troubleshooting#search-and-discovery-issues).

## Install Claude Code

To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**

```batch
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

If you see `The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator`, you're in PowerShell, not CMD. Use the PowerShell command above instead. Your prompt shows `PS C:\` when you're in PowerShell.

**Windows requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).** Install it first if you don't have it.

Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.

**Homebrew:**

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

Homebrew installations do not auto-update. Run `brew upgrade claude-code` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

**WinGet:**

```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

WinGet installations do not auto-update. Run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

After installation completes, open a terminal in the project you want to work in and start Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

If you encounter any issues during installation, see the [troubleshooting guide](/en/troubleshooting).

### Set up on Windows

Claude Code on Windows requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) or WSL. You can launch `claude` from PowerShell, CMD, or Git Bash. Claude Code uses Git Bash internally to run commands. You do not need to run PowerShell as Administrator.

**Option 1: Native Windows with Git Bash**

Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win), then run the install command from PowerShell or CMD.

If Claude Code can't find your Git Bash installation, set the path in your [settings.json file](/en/settings):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
  }
}
```

Claude Code can also run PowerShell natively on Windows as an opt-in preview. See [PowerShell tool](/en/tools-reference#powershell-tool) for setup and limitations.

**Option 2: WSL**

Both WSL 1 and WSL 2 are supported. WSL 2 supports [sandboxing](/en/sandboxing) for enhanced security. WSL 1 does not support sandboxing.

### Alpine Linux and musl-based distributions

The native installer on Alpine and other musl/uClibc-based distributions requires `libgcc`, `libstdc++`, and `ripgrep`. Install these using your distribution's package manager, then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0`.

This example installs the required packages on Alpine:

```bash
apk add libgcc libstdc++ ripgrep
```

Then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP` to `0` in your [`settings.json`](/en/settings#available-settings) file:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP": "0"
  }
}
```

## Verify your installation

After installing, confirm Claude Code is working:

```bash
claude --version
```

For a more detailed check of your installation and configuration, run [`claude doctor`](/en/troubleshooting#get-more-help):

```bash
claude doctor
```

## Authenticate

Claude Code requires a Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise, or Console account. The free Claude.ai plan does not include Claude Code access. You can also use Claude Code with a third-party API provider like [Amazon Bedrock](/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Vertex AI](/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Microsoft Foundry](/en/microsoft-foundry).

After installing, log in by running `claude` and following the browser prompts. See [Authentication](/en/authentication) for all account types and team setup options.

## Update Claude Code

Native installations automatically update in the background. You can [configure the release channel](#configure-release-channel) to control whether you receive updates immediately or on a delayed stable schedule, or [disable auto-updates](#disable-auto-updates) entirely. Homebrew and WinGet installations require manual updates.

### Auto-updates

Claude Code checks for updates on startup and periodically while running. Updates download and install in the background, then take effect the next time you start Claude Code.

Homebrew and WinGet installations do not auto-update. Use `brew upgrade claude-code` or `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` to update manually.

Homebrew keeps old versions on disk after upgrades. Run `brew cleanup claude-code` periodically to reclaim disk space.

### Configure release channel

Control which release channel Claude Code follows for auto-updates and `claude update` with the `autoUpdatesChannel` setting:

* `"latest"`, the default: receive new features as soon as they're released
* `"stable"`: use a version that is typically about one week old, skipping releases with major regressions

Configure this via `/config` → **Auto-update channel**, or add it to your [settings.json file](/en/settings):

```json
{
  "autoUpdatesChannel": "stable"
}
```

For enterprise deployments, you can enforce a consistent release channel across your organization using [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings).

### Disable auto-updates

Set `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` to `"1"` in the `env` key of your [`settings.json`](/en/settings#available-settings) file:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  }
}
```

### Update manually

To apply an update immediately without waiting for the next background check, run:

```bash
claude update
```

## Advanced installation options

These options are for version pinning, migrating from npm, and verifying binary integrity.

### Install a specific version

The native installer accepts either a specific version number or a release channel (`latest` or `stable`). The channel you choose at install time becomes your default for auto-updates.

To install the latest version (default):

```bash
# macOS, Linux, WSL
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

To install the stable version:

```bash
# macOS, Linux, WSL
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s stable

# Windows PowerShell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) stable
```

To install a specific version number:

```bash
# macOS, Linux, WSL
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s 2.1.89

# Windows PowerShell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) 2.1.89
```

### Deprecated npm installation

npm installation is deprecated. The native installer is faster, requires no dependencies, and auto-updates in the background. Use the [native installation](#install-claude-code) method when possible.

#### Migrate from npm to native

If you previously installed Claude Code with npm, switch to the native installer:

```bash
# Install the native binary
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Remove the old npm installation
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

You can also run `claude install` from an existing npm installation to install the native binary alongside it, then remove the npm version.

#### Install with npm

If you need npm installation for compatibility reasons, you must have [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. Install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Do NOT use `sudo npm install -g` as this can lead to permission issues and security risks.

### Binary integrity and code signing

Each release publishes a `manifest.json` containing SHA256 checksums for every platform binary. The manifest is signed with an Anthropic GPG key, so verifying the signature on the manifest transitively verifies every binary it lists.

#### Verify the manifest signature

**Step 1: Download and import the public key**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://downloads.claude.ai/keys/claude-code.asc | gpg --import
gpg --fingerprint security@anthropic.com
```

Confirm the output includes this fingerprint:

```
31DD DE24 DDFA B679 F42D  7BD2 BAA9 29FF 1A7E CACE
```

**Step 2: Download the manifest and signature**

```bash
REPO=https://storage.googleapis.com/claude-code-dist-86c565f3-f756-42ad-8dfa-d59b1c096819/claude-code-releases
VERSION=2.1.89
curl -fsSLO "$REPO/$VERSION/manifest.json"
curl -fsSLO "$REPO/$VERSION/manifest.json.sig"
```

**Step 3: Verify the signature**

```bash
gpg --verify manifest.json.sig manifest.json
```

A valid result reports `Good signature from "Anthropic Claude Code Release Signing <security@anthropic.com>"`.

**Step 4: Check the binary against the manifest**

```bash
# Linux
sha256sum claude

# macOS
shasum -a 256 claude

# Windows PowerShell
(Get-FileHash claude.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
```

Manifest signatures are available for releases from `2.1.89` onward.

#### Platform code signatures

In addition to the signed manifest, individual binaries carry platform-native code signatures where supported.

* **macOS**: signed by "Anthropic PBC" and notarized by Apple. Verify with `codesign --verify --verbose ./claude`.
* **Windows**: signed by "Anthropic, PBC". Verify with `Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\claude.exe`.
* **Linux**: use the manifest signature above to verify integrity. Linux binaries are not individually code-signed.
